#anything under single or double quote is string
name="abhishek"
print(name)
apple='he said," i want to eat an apple'
banana=''' so this is how you use 
a multiline string
for example if i say
kem chho here
it get printed
'''
# print(apple)
# print("hello",apple)
# print(banana)
print(name[0])
print(name[1])
print(name[2])
print(name[3])
print(name[4])
print(name[5])
print(name[6])
print(name[7])


#looping through an string
print("lets us use an for loop")
for character in banana:
    print(character)
