# 🐍 Python Projects & Code Work

Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository!  
This repo contains all my Python code snippets, exercises, and mini-projects, neatly organized inside the **`code_work/`** folder.

It’s a mix of foundational programs, data structure implementations, and small-scale problem-solving scripts — a space where I continuously learn, experiment, and improve my Python skills.
